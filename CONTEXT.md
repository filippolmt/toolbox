# Context

Project-specific vocabulary used by AI tooling and code reviewers. Add a
term here when a refactor or design conversation gives a new concept its
name; the file is the single source of truth for what those concepts mean
in this codebase.

## Glossary

### Mount Plan

The full pipeline that turns a `Config` and a workspace path into the
typed bind set handed to `ContainerCreate`, plus the shell `WorkingDir`.

Concretely: `defaults() → applyMountsRoot → mergeMounts → resolveAll →
append workspace bind → append host-path mirror (when safe)`. Owned by
`internal/mountplan`. The single seam runtime callers and tests cross is
`mountplan.Plan(cfg, workspace)`; pure merge inspection (no filesystem
side-effects) is exposed as `mountplan.Merge(cfg)`.

Why the term exists: before this concept was named, the same logic was
spread across `internal/config` (defaults + merge + root retarget),
`internal/mount` (filesystem resolve), and `internal/container/lifecycle`
(workspace + DooD-mirror append). Reading any one stage missed the
others; tests stubbed each in isolation and bugs hid in the handoffs.
The "Mount Plan" name turns one fragmented walk into one deep module.
